# PYTHON

## MATPLOTLIB

`plt.yticks([0,2,4,6,8,10],['0','2B','4B','6B','8B','10B'])`

## PANDAS

`brics.index = ['BR','RU','IN','CN','SA']`

`brics = pd.read_csv('brics.csv', index_col = 0)`

loc (location-based) access:

`brics.loc['RU']`

- to get a dataframe, use double brackets: `brics.loc[['RU']]`
- can select multiple rows
- can select rows & columns: `brics.loc[['RU','CN'], ['country','capital']]`

iloc (index location-based) access:

`brics.iloc[[1]]`

- `brics.iloc[[1,2,3]]`
- `brics.iloc[[1,2,3], [1,2]]`

`dogs.sort_values(['weight','height'],ascending=[True,False])`

`dogs['color'].isin(['Black','Brown'])`

## DICTIONARIES

`world = {'afghanistan':30.55, 'albania':2.77, 'algeria':39.21}`

- `world['albania']` returns 2.77

## LOOPS

For dictionary:

`for key, val in my_dict.items():`

For 2D numpy arrays:

`for val in np.nditer(my_array):`

For dataframes:

`for lab, row in brics.iterrows()`

# SQL

Selecting distinct records:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year_hired
FROM employees;
```

VIEW. Virtual table that is the result of a saved SQL SELECT statement.

- When accessed, views automatically update in response to updates in the underlying data.

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_hire_years AS
SELECT id, name, year_hired
FROM employees;
```

### FILTERING

`WHERE`

- `OR`
- `AND`
- `BETWEEN`. Inclusive.

`LIKE`.

- `%` wildcard. Match zero, one or many characters:
  - `WHERE name LIKE 'Ade%'` matches Adel and Adelaide.
- `_` wildcard. Matches a single character:
  - `WHERE name LIKE 'Ev_'` matches Eve but NOT Even

`NOT LIKE`

Note `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` are case-sensitive.

`IN`.

- `WHERE release_year IN (1920, 1930, 1940)`

`WHERE birthdate IS NULL`

`WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL`

### AGGREGATING

```sql
SELECT COUNT (name) AS count
FROM people;
```

`HAVING` is required to select based on group aggregate statistics.
