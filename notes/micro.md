# 1. Ten Principles of Economics

Resources are scarce.

- SCARCITY. The limited nature of society's resources.
- ECONOMICS. The study of how society manages its scarce resources.

## HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS

1\. People face trade-offs.

2\. The cost of something is what you give up to get it.

- OPPORTUNITY COST. Whatever must be given up to obtain some item.

3\. Rational people think at the margin.

4\. People respond to incentives.

## HOW PEOPLE INTERACT

5\. Trade can make everyone better off.

6\. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity.

- MARKET. Group of buyers and sellers. Allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets.
- Adam Smith's INVISIBLE HAND. Prices guide self-interested households and firms to make decisions that maximize society's economic well-being.

7\. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes.

- Enforcing property rights.
- Promoting efficiency.
- Promoting equality.

## HOW THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WORKS

8\. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.

9\. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.

- INFLATION. An increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.
  - Almost always caused by excessive growth in the quantity of money, causing the value of money to fall.

10\. Society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

# 2. Thinking Like an Economist

## SCIENTIST

Economists make assumptions.

- Simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand.

Economists use models to study economic issues.

- Simplified representation of a more complicated reality.

CIRCULAR FLOW DIAGRAM. Visual model of the economy showing how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.

- Two decisionmakers: firms and households.
- Interacting in two markets:
  - PRODUCT MARKET. Market for goods and services.
  - RESOURCE MARKET. Market for factors of production.

### PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER.

Points on the PPF are efficient.

Points under the PPF are possible, but inefficient.

Points above the PPF are not possible.

Slope of the PPF reflects the opportunist cost of one good in terms of the other.

Shape of the PPF:

- Straight line = constant opportunity cost.
- Bowed outwards = increasing opportunity cost.
  - As more units of a good are produced, we need to give up increasing amounts of the other good produced

## POLICY ADVISER

Give prescriptive advice about how to improve the economy.

When economists disagree, it's primarily because they have different values and therefore different normative views about what policy should try to accomplish.
